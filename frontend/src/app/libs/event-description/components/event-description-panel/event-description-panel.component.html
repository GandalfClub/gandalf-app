			<p>Hello! Codeforces Round #656 (Div. 3) will start at Friday, July 17, 2020 at 17:35. You will be offered 6
				or 7 problems (or 8) with expected difficulties to compose an interesting competition for participants
				with ratings up to 1600. However, all of you who wish to take part and have rating 1600 or higher, can
				register for the round unofficially.</p>
			<p>The round will be hosted by rules of educational rounds (extended ACM-ICPC). Thus, during the round,
				solutions will be judged on preliminary tests, and after the round it will be a 12-hour phase of open
				hacks. I tried to make strong tests &mdash; just like you will be upset if many solutions fail after the
				contest is over.</p>
			<p>You will be given 6 or 7 (or 8) problems and 2 hours to solve them.</p>
			<p>Note that the penalty for the wrong submission in this round (and the following Div. 3 rounds) is 10
				minutes.</p>
			<p>Remember that only the trusted participants of the third division will be included in the official
				standings table. As it is written by link, this is a compulsory measure for combating unsporting
				behavior. To qualify as a trusted participants of the third division, you must:</p>
			<p>take part in at least two rated rounds (and solve at least one problem in each of them),</p>
			<p>do not have a point of 1900 or higher in the rating.</p>
